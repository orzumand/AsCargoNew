              Your privacy holds immense value to us at AS CARGO LLC As a
              result, we have designed this policy to help you understand how we
              gather, employ, communicate, and make use of your personal
              information. Here's an overview of our privacy policy.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>
                As you interact with our website, we collect specific
                information about you.
              </b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Our website, like other commercial ones, uses a standard
              technology called "cookies" (refer to the explanation below) and
              server logs to gather information about the usage of our site. The
              data gathered through cookies and server logs may include the date
              and time of visits, pages viewed, browser and device information,
              geographical location, duration spent on our site, websites
              visited immediately before and after ours, as well as your IP
              address.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b> Mobile Texting / Privacy SMS</b>
              <br />

              <br />
              Upon becoming a customer through our platforms, you provide your
              phone number to us at AS CARGO LLC.
              <br />
              <br />

              We may use your phone number to confirm orders, deliver ongoing
              training or communication, and to send text updates, promotions,
              videos, audios, or messages associated with AS CARGO LLC or any of
              its programs or brands. If you wish to opt-out of receiving future
              text messages, you can do so at any time by following the opt-out
              instructions in the text message. By signing up for our products
              or programs, you grant us permission to text you until you
              indicate otherwise. Rest assured, we never sell or rent your phone
              number and we communicate with you solely regarding relevant
              programs.
              <br />

              <br />
              <b> Use of Cookies</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              A cookie is a minuscule text document, which often carries an
              anonymous unique identifier. When you visit a website, that site's
              computer asks your computer for permission to store this file in a
              section of your hard drive specifically designated for cookies.
              Each website can send its own cookie to your browser if your
              browser's preferences permit it, but to safeguard your privacy,
              your browser only allows a website to access the cookies it has
              previously sent to you, not the cookies sent to you by other
              websites.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b> Third-Party Analytics and Advertising Providers</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              We might use third-party services provided by Google or Facebook
              for analytics, marketing, or remarketing services. These companies
              compile statistical reports that aid in analyzing how visitors use
              our website, enabling us to advertise services or products based
              on these reports. Additionally, these companies gather statistical
              data that permits us and other companies to participate in
              marketing campaigns on their platforms. Such advertising services
              may occur on or by Facebook, Facebook Pixel, DoubleClick, Google
              Analytics, Google search results pages, or on a site in the Google
              Display Network. These companies use pixels (small snippets of
              code) to serve ads to someone based on past visits to our website
              or other websites.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>IP Addresses</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Your computer uses IP addresses each time you connect to the
              Internet. Your IP address is a number utilized by computers on the
              network to identify your computer. IP addresses are automatically
              gathered by our web server as part of demographic and profile data
              known as “traffic data” so that data (such as the Web pages you
              request) can be sent to you.
              <br />
              <br />
              <b>Email Information</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Should you choose to correspond with us via email, we may retain
              the content of your email messages along with your email address
              and our responses. We provide the same protections for these
              electronic communications that we employ in the maintenance of
              information received online, by mail, and by telephone. This also
              applies when you register for our website, sign up through any of
              our forms using your email address or make a purchase on this
              site. For more information, please see the email policies below.

              <b>How Do We Utilize the Personal Information Provided by You?</b>
              <br />
              <br />
              Generally speaking, we employ personal information for the
              administration of our business activities, customer service, and
              offering other items and services to our customers and prospective
              customers.
              <br />
              <br />
              We do not acquire personally-identifying information about you
              when you visit our site unless you willingly provide such
              information to us. Such information will neither be sold nor
              transferred to unaffiliated third parties without user approval at
              the time of collection.
              <br />
              <br />
              We may disclose information when legally compelled to do so; in
              other words, when we believe in good faith that the law mandates
              it or for the protection of our legal rights.
              <br />
              <br />
              We will communicate and respond to email inquiries. When you
              interact with us through our website or email, we will communicate
              with you via your email address to provide information about AS
              CARGO LLC, our programs, investment inventory, upcoming
              educational opportunities, or with educational opportunities
              offered by companies we've partnered with.
              <br />
              <br />
              We may conduct analysis or research about our website, business,
              or product offerings. Occasionally, we may reach out to you to
              participate in surveys or provide information so that we can
              enhance the quality of our inventory, our programs, and our
              business, or to ask you to review your experience working with AS
              CARGO LLC.
              <br />
              <br />
              No mobile information will be shared with third parties/affiliates
              for marketing/promotional purposes. Information sharing to
              subcontractors in support services, such as customer service, is
              permitted. All other use case categories exclude text messaging
              originator opt-in data and consent; this information will not be
              shared with any third parties
